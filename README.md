# Antikythera clock #

This is a mockup for an eventual Pebble watchface, named for [the Antikythera
mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) because this has to do with the
positions of the planets.

A brief explanation:

* the innermost ring shows the hour, from 1 to 12
* the outermost ring shows the minute, from 1 to 60
* the dots around the edge appear every 2 seconds; a full array of dots is 30 seconds past the
  minute, and they clear at a new minute.
* the shaded region indicates sunrise and sunset; a flat line across would indicate a sunrise at
  6:00 am and a sunset at 6:00 pm
* the white ray extending from the middle shows the position of the sun in the sky â€“ pointing left
  indicates sunrise, pointing right, sunset, and pointing straight up, solar noon.
* the black ray extending from the middle shows the position of the moon in a similar way
* the downward-pointed triangle represents Venus and shows its position along the sky similarly to
  the rays for the sun and moon
* the upward-pointed triangle represents Mars analogously
* the square represents Jupiter in the same way
